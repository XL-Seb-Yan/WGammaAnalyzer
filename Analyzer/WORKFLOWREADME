Work flow:

1. miniAOD -> /Selection/select.C -> MC ntuples normalized to integrated luminosity of data (ntuple1)

2. ntuple1 -> /Analyzer/cutselection.C (without weight) -> ntuples with _presel (ntuple2)

3. ntuple2 -> /Analyzer/Histomake.C -> histograms

4. histograms -> /Analyzer/Histofit.C -> determin fit factor f

5. ntuple1 -> /Analyzer/cutselection.C (with weight f) -> ntuples with _weightedTo41p54_fitData (ntuple3)

6. ntuple3 -> /Analyzer/Histomake.C -> histograms_fullyweighted -> /Analyzer/Histoplot.C

or

ntuple3 -> hadd -> cut optimization
